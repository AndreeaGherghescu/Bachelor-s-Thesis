## Find your music

Find your music aims to be an introduction to the world of music and ease the process of finding a song. After entering a 10-second music segment, the algorithm will scan its database and return the name of the recognized song.
For each song in the database, there will be versions of it in other musical genres, processed with the help of artificial intelligence models. This aspect will allow the application to recognize songs in unfavorable contexts, such as the existence of noise, reinterpretations or mixes.
